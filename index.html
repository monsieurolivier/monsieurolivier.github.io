                        <h1>A JOURNEY INTO WEB DEV</h1>

                        <p>I'm a self taught web developer, or at least I intend to become one. I've been working in the tech buisiness for a few years now, and I have acquired experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, databases, PHP, Ruby, React, Angular, ... but I never has the chance to work on real projects as a developer. So, in August 2019, I decided to embark on a journey to consolidate all my knowledge as a web developer and start my own projects. My first step is to follow a learning path that will lead me there. I found an interesting path already built on Github, writen by <a href = "https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides" target="_blank">P1xt</a>, that I decided to try. In the next sections, I will show my progress within this path. At the moment I am writing this page, this is what represents the most my online presence. It will evolve in the future for sure and become more and more rich in content.</p>
